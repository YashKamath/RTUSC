<b><i><a href="#FAQ1">What is Review Team?</a></i></b>
<br>
ReviewTeam: campus-wide on demand essay review, anytime, anywhere. Our vision is  to provide every single student on USC’s campus access to quick essay editing. 
<br>
<b><i><a href="#FAQ2">Who can submit essays?</a></i></b>
<br>
Undergraduate students all across campus can submit their essays through our streamlined website, which allows for effective and efficient reviewer-reviewee feedback within hours of submission. 
<br>
<b><i><a href="#FAQ3">Who can review essays?</a></i></b>
<br>
Only reviewers who are majoring in the humanities, have extensive writing experience, and have completed our mandatory testing and training process are allowed to review essays.
<br>
<b><i><a href="#FAQ4">How long does the whole essay submission, editing, and return process take?</a></i></b>
<br>
Within five minutes, the student will be able to navigate through their portal and submit their essay for review. By the end of the day, they will have a completely commented, reviewed essay which they can build upon as they continue their essay writing process.  
<br>
<b><i><a href="#FAQ5">What types of writing are allowed?</a></i></b>
Review Team will accept any type of writing (resume, personal statement, academic essay, research paper, creative writing) as long as it is under 10 pages in length.
<br>
<br>
<b><i><a href="#FAQ6">How much does the service cost?</a></i></b>
<br>
Our costs are determined by the length of your document in words. The longer the writing, the higher the cost. 
<br>
<b><i><a href="#FAQ7">What is the essay return time?</a></i></b>
<br>
We offer 4 distinct return time options for our buyers:
<ul>
	<li>RUSH - 6 hour return</li>
	<li>STANDARD - 24 hour return</li>
	<li>LONG - 48 hour return</li>
	<li>PREPARED - Week long return</li>
</ul>
The return time will not affect the quality of your essay feedback. A RUSH review will have the same high quality feedback that you would receive if you ordered a prepared review.
